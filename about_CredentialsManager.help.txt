Even if administrators or other users do have access to credentials files (i.e. on a network shares), they will not be able to decrypt it.

$Cred = Read-Credential -Environment Dev                                                  # Gets username and password from files saved in repository and saves it in variable
Get-WMIObject Win32_Service -Computer DC1 -Credential (Read-Credential -Environment Dev)  # Gets credentials from repository and directly uses it in network operation
